A custom vimrc

TL;DR - make vim an IDE. OG VimChad

Reasoning
---------

I am no Vim guru but am proficient in small code bases. NVChad recently popped
up onto my radar and I used NeoVim quite happily, briefly. 

It crashed on me trying to run a :g command on a ~500mb file. Unacceptable.
Vim has performed this for me on larger files before. 

But NVChad really impressed me with look and feel so I wanted to try replicate
that in OG Vim. Think of it as VimChad, NVChad's vimscript cousin

Not all functionality has or will be ported, a lot relies heavily on plugins -
Vim can do most of it in-built, but plugins provide a better experience, i.e.
LSP completion

Also has my own personal preferences/ customisation
